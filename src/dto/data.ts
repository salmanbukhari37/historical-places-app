      "The pyramid complex at Giza may be one of the most famous historical sites in the world. But their inception, construction and purpose still remain a huge mystery. The Pyramid of Djoser, which is believed to be the oldest pyramid in Egypt, dates back to 2630 BC. It was built in the Saqqara necropolis for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser. This is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The main pyramid complex close to the present-day city of Cairo comprises three larger and three smaller pyramids along with the enigmatic Great Sphinx. Archaeologists believe the mysterious limestone sculpture with the head of a human and the body of a lion predates most of the other ancient structures in the area by 2,000 years or so. Meanwhile, the oldest and largest of the three big pyramids is the Great Pyramid of Khufu. It was built between 2589 and 2566 BC. It is also one of the only structures in the area that are mostly intact.",

      "Chances are that even if you have not visited the Great Wall of China in Beijing, you must have at least seen it in a movie. One of the most popular historical places to visit around the world, this 21,196-kilometre long wall was built during different dynasties in ancient China. The structure is built of stone, wood and other materials, spanning from east to west. These fortifications were made to keep the invaders at bay.Archeologists believe the oldest section of this architectural marvel was constructed in the 7BC. However, some historians suggest it was commissioned sometime around 200 BC.A number of emperors made modifications to the great wall. However, the Ming Dynasty joined different parts of the wall and built even more sections. The present structure around Beijing, which comprises barracks, guard towers and fortresses, was built between 1368 and 1644 by the Great Ming Empire.This historical site remains one of the most popular tourist attractions in Asia, with travelers from all across the world visiting it.",

      "More popularly known as 'The Lost City of the Incas,' Machu Picchu in Peru is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful sites on the list. The archaeological city with perfectly carved stone structures is an architectural marvel tucked away on top of a mountain ridge in the Cusco region. Dating back to 1438 AD, this ancient citadel is believed to have been built as a summer retreat for Inca emperors. This Peruvian sanctuary was abandoned in the 16th century during the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire. When Spaniards were wiping out Incan settlements, Machu Picchu only remained safe due to its inhospitable location. An American archaeologist discovered the site in 1911. It has since become one of the most historical places to visit around the world. The ruins of Machu Picchu include three primary structures: the Temple of Three Windows, the Temple of Sun and the Intihuatana Stone, a ritual stone associated with the astronomic clock of the lost civilization.",
